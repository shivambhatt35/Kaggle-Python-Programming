# Kaggle Python Programming

This repository contains **solutions and explanations** for the **[Kaggle Python Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)**. It is designed for beginners to build a **strong Python foundation** with practical exercises and clear examples, applicable to **data science and analytics**.

---

## Course Overview

The course introduces Python programming through **hands-on exercises** and **real-world examples**. Learners gain skills in:

- Core Python syntax, data types, and expressions  
- Writing **functions** and using built-in libraries  
- Controlling program flow with **conditionals and loops**  
- Manipulating **lists, strings, and dictionaries**  
- Using **external libraries** like `NumPy` and `Pandas` for data handling  

Configuration and practice exercises are structured with **YAML/JSON templates** for rules and settings, allowing organized, repeatable learning workflows.
